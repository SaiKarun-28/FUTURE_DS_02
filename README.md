## 📊 Project Overview

This project involves the development of a comprehensive **Social Media Ads Campaign Dashboard** designed to analyze the performance of various marketing campaigns. The dashboard provides actionable insights into Return on Investment (ROI), customer engagement, revenue distribution, and demographic targeting.

By visualizing key metrics, stakeholders can identify high-performing campaigns and optimize marketing budgets for future strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **Microsoft Power BI** (Data Visualization & Dashboarding)
* **Excel / CSV** (Data Source)
* **Data Cleaning & Processing** (Power Query)

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard tracks the following high-level metrics to gauge overall campaign health:

* **Total ROI:** 3.24M
* **Total Impressions:** 79M
* **Engagement Rate:** 888.04 (Sum)
* **Total Clicks:** 24K
* **Total Conversions:** 2K
* **Total CTR:** 0.16

## 🔎 Dashboard Features & Visualizations

### 1. Campaign Performance Analysis
* **Revenue by Campaign:** A pie chart visualization showing the dominance of the **"Festive Offer Drive"** (60.97% of revenue), followed by the "Fashion Week Special" (31.93%).
* **Engagement Funnel:** A funnel chart highlighting that the "Festive Offer Drive" also leads in engagement rate (800.00), significantly outperforming the "Summer Buzz Campaign."
* **Temporal Trends:** An area chart tracking engagement rates over time, highlighting specific peaks in late August (likely correlating with campaign launch dates).

### 2. Demographic Insights
* **Age Analysis:**
    * **Clicks by Age:** The **30-34 age group** generates the highest volume of clicks across all campaigns.
    * **Engagement by Age:** Engagement drops sharply after the 30-34 age bracket, indicating this is the primary target audience.
    * **Revenue by Age:** The 30-34 demographic contributes **42.97%** of the total revenue.
* **Gender Distribution:** A clustered bar chart comparing revenue contributions by gender across different campaigns, showing a relatively balanced split with a slight female lead in the "Festive Offer Drive."

## 💡 Key Business Insights derived from Data

1.  **Top Performer:** The **Festive Offer Drive** is the undisputed champion of this cycle, generating the majority of both revenue and engagement.
2.  **Target Audience:** The data strongly suggests that the ideal customer profile is within the **30-34 age range**. Marketing efforts targeting users above 40 yield significantly lower ROI and engagement.
3.  **Campaign Lag:** The **Summer Buzz Campaign** is underperforming (only 7.1% of revenue). A strategic review is recommended to either optimize the creative assets or reallocate its budget to the "Fashion Week" or "Festive" categories.
4.  **Conversion Funnel:** While impressions are high (79M), the total conversion count is 2K. This suggests a need to optimize the **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** and landing page experience to close the gap between views and purchases.

## 🚀 How to Use
1.  Download the `.pbix` file (if available in the repo).
2.  Open the file using **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**.
3.  Interact with the slicers to filter data by Campaign Name, Gender, or Date.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
* Integration of live API data for real-time tracking.
* Addition of "Cost per Acquisition" (CPA) metrics.
* Sentiment analysis on social media comments.
